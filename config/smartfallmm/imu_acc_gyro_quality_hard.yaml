# Accelerometer + Gyroscope with Hard Quality Filtering
# 6 channels: [ax, ay, az, gx, gy, gz]
#
# Hard filtering mode: Skip trials entirely if gyroscope SNR < threshold.
# This ensures only high-quality IMU data is used for training.
#
# Trade-off:
# - Pro: Cleaner training signal (SNR ≥ 1.0)
# - Con: Loses ~64.6% of trials (S50-63 have poor gyro quality)

# Expected behavior:
# - Only trials with SNR ≥ 1.0 will be used for training
# - Approximately 35% of trials retained (Group 1: 55.6%, Group 2: 23.9%)
# - Cleaner training signal but significantly reduced sample size
# - May improve performance if quality matters more than quantity
# - Risk of overfitting due to reduced training data
#
# Comparison with raw baseline (imu_acc_gyro_raw.yaml):
# - Raw: 1700 samples with mixed quality
# - Hard filtered: ~595 samples with SNR ≥ 1.0
