# Accelerometer + SMV Transformer with Motion Filtering
# 4 channels: [SMV, ax, ay, az] produced from accelerometer watch data
#
# This configuration adds motion threshold filtering to the baseline TransModel
# to match Android app inference behavior: only windows with ≥2 axes exceeding
# |10| m/s² are used for training, matching the app's makeInference() logic.
