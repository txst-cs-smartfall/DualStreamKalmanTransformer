# Notes:
# V2 IMPROVEMENTS:
# - 1.5x larger embeddings (acc: 16→24, gyro: 8→12)
# - More transformer layers for gyro (gyro: 1→2, acc stays at 2)
# - 2x more attention heads (2→4)
# - Expected params: ~15-18K (vs 5.9K in V1, ~60-65% of baseline)
# - Asymmetric design reflects domain knowledge (acc > gyro importance)
# - Learnable fusion weights for interpretability
# - Should achieve competitive performance with baseline while maintaining efficiency
