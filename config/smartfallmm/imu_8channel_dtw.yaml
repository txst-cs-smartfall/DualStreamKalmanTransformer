# IMU 8-Channel Transformer with DTW Alignment
# 8 channels: [acc_smv, ax, ay, az, gyro_mag, gx, gy, gz]
# DTW aligns gyroscope to accelerometer (per-trial, pre-windowing)
# Handles potential temporal misalignment between IMU sensors

# Notes:
# - Uses 8-channel input with engineered features (SMV, gyro magnitude)
# - DTW alignment enabled: gyroscope aligned to accelerometer as ground truth
# - Per-trial alignment (before sliding window extraction)
# - C-optimized DTW for speed (multi-core friendly)
# - Architecture identical to TransModel (only input channels differ)
# - Expected performance: 85-90% test accuracy (exceeding acc-only baseline if async is an issue)
