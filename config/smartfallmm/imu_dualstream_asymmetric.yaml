# Notes:
# - Asymmetric architecture: acc (16d, 2 layers) vs gyro (8d, 1 layer)
# - Learnable fusion weights balance acc and gyro contributions
# - Initialized with acc=0.7, gyro=0.3 based on domain knowledge
# - More parameters than Options 1-2 (~35K params) but still much less than baseline
# - Suitable for real-time inference on Android devices
# - Can inspect learned fusion weights for interpretability
