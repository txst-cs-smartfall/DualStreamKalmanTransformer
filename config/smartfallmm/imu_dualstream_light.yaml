weight_decay: 1e-3     # Increased weight decay for better regularization (was 5e-4)

# Notes:
# - Independent streams learn modality-specific representations
# - Each stream is very small (8 dimensions) to prevent overfitting
# - More parameters than shared version but still lightweight (~25K params)
# - Better interpretability: can analyze acc vs gyro contributions
# - Suitable for real-time inference on Android devices
