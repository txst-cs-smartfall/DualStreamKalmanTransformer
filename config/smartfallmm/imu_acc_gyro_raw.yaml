# Raw Accelerometer + Gyroscope Transformer (No Quality Filtering)
# 6 channels: [ax, ay, az, gx, gy, gz]
#
# This configuration uses raw IMU data without quality assessment or filtering.
# Baseline for comparing against quality-filtered and sensor fusion approaches.
#
# Expected challenges:
# - Poor gyroscope quality (SNR < 1.0 for 76% of Group 2 subjects)
# - Noise-dominated signal may degrade performance vs acc-only
# - Useful for establishing lower bound performance

# Expected behavior:
# - Uses all available trials regardless of gyroscope quality
# - Direct concatenation of accelerometer and gyroscope data
# - No SMV feature (raw 3+3 channels only)
# - Likely to underperform acc-only due to poor gyro quality
# - Serves as baseline for quality filtering comparisons
