# IMU Transformer with Timestamp-Based Alignment
# ==============================================
#
# This config enables timestamp-based linear interpolation to align
# accelerometer and gyroscope data that have different sampling rates.
#
# Problem: Android IMU API delivers acc and gyro at DIFFERENT rates
# (e.g., acc at 87Hz, gyro at 52Hz), causing sample count mismatches
# even when recordings are perfectly synchronized.
#
# Solution: Parse ISO timestamps, find overlap region, interpolate
# both modalities to a common 30Hz grid.
