# Option 1: Shared-Weight Dual Stream IMU Configuration
# Minimal parameters through weight sharing between acc and gyro streams
# Optimal for preventing overfitting with limited data

# Notes:
# - Shared-weight architecture minimizes parameters (~15K vs 110K baseline)
# - Weight sharing between acc and gyro provides natural regularization
# - Suitable for limited training data (30 subjects)
# - Real-time inference friendly on Android devices
