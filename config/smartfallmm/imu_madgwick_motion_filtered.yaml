# Madgwick Sensor Fusion with Motion Filtering
# Model 4: 7 channels [smv, ax, ay, az, roll, pitch, yaw] from Madgwick AHRS
#
# OPTIMIZED to prevent overfitting:
# - Reduced architecture depth (2 layers instead of 3)
# - Moderate capacity (embed_dim=64 instead of 96)
# - Strong regularization (dropout 0.6)
# - Low-pass filtering before fusion
# - Class-aware stride for balanced training
#
# Research-based optimizations:
# - Zhang et al. (2024): Madgwick+ResNet achieved 97.13% accuracy
# - Madgwick beta=0.1 optimal for 30Hz sampling (Madgwick, 2010)
# - Orientation features more interpretable than raw gyro

# Expected behavior:
# - Madgwick fuses acc+gyro → orientation (roll, pitch, yaw)
# - Orientation features capture device pose relative to gravity
# - Low-pass filtering before fusion removes sensor noise
# - Moderate architecture prevents overfitting on small dataset
# - Class-aware stride balances ADL/Fall samples
