# Accelerometer-Only Transformer with Motion Filtering
# 4 channels: [SMV, ax, ay, az]
#
# This configuration replicates Android app inference behavior by applying
# motion threshold filtering: only windows with ≥2 axes exceeding |10| m/s²
# are used for training, matching the app's makeInference() logic.

# Expected behavior:
# - Training data distribution will match Android app inference
# - Only "active" windows (motion detected) used for training
# - Should improve precision by reducing false positives on quiet periods
# - May slightly reduce recall if falls have low-motion periods
