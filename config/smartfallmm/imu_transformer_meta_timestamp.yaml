# IMUTransformer: Acc+Gyro with META_WRIST Sensors + TIMESTAMP ALIGNMENT
# *** KEY TEST: Timestamp-based alignment to recover 8 failed subjects ***
#
# Previous result (DTW): 20/28 subjects (8 subjects failed due to acc-gyro length mismatches)
# Expected result (timestamp): 28/28 subjects (all recovered via timestamp matching!)
#
# This config enables timestamp-based alignment which solves the problem where:
# - Meta_wrist acc samples at 25Hz, gyro at 32Hz (not the claimed 50Hz)
# - Gyro continues recording after acc stops (e.g., 117s vs 75s)
# - Sample count differences range from 12 to 2040 samples
#
# Timestamp alignment matches samples by their epoch_ms timestamps (±20ms tolerance)
# instead of by sample index, recovering 100% of accelerometer data.
