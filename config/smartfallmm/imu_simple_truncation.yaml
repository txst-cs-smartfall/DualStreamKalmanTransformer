# IMU Transformer with Simple Truncation for Acc+Gyro
#
# Key change: Uses simple truncation instead of complex timestamp alignment
# This just truncates both modalities to the shorter length when diff <= 50 samples
# Much simpler and more robust than DTW or timestamp interpolation
#
# Architecture: IMUTransformer (same as imu_baseline but with simple truncation)
# Channels: 6 (ax, ay, az, gx, gy, gz) - NO SMV
#
# Expected: More trials retained, better class balance
