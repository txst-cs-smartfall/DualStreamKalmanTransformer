# Lightweight Dual Stream IMU with Motion Filtering
# Model 3: Separate encoders for acc (4ch) and gyro (4ch), then fused
# 4ch each: [x, y, z, magnitude] with motion filtering
#
# OPTIMIZED to prevent overfitting on ~1000 samples:
# - Ultra-lightweight architecture (~15-20K params)
# - Strong regularization (dropout 0.7)
# - Low-pass filtering to reduce noise-based false positives
# - Class-aware stride to balance ADL/Fall samples

# Expected behavior:

# - Fusion combines acc (reliable) + gyro (rotation info)
# - Strong regularization prevents overfitting
# - Motion filtering + low-pass filter reduce false positives
# - Class-aware stride balances ADL/Fall samples
